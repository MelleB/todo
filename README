todo.hs
-------
An command line based todo list written in Haskell.

The functionality of this todo list is shamelessly copied from Gina Trapani's 
todo.txt (http://todotxt.com). 

What I didn't like about todo.txt's implementation is being limited to a
single todo list. I preferred more related to git, i.e. navigating up the
directory structure until you've found a todo.txt file.

This is my first "real" experience with Haskell, so if you find any bugs, or
see any room for code improvement, please (PLEASE!) tell me about it. 


Requirements
------------
This application has been tested on Ubuntu 10.10 running GHC 6.12.1
AFAIK, requirements are limited to GHC 6.12.1 (earlier versions may work too).


Usage
-----
Usage is pretty much the same as the todotxt's implementation, instead of
using projects and contexts it simply uses tags to group items. Furtheremore
I renamed the "do" command to "did" (you're only completing an item once it's
done right?). A brief overview of the commands:

Add or modify an item
 $ todo add [+tag] Item
 $ todo mod X [+-tag]

E.g. 
 $ todo add +todohs +doc "Writing documentation"
 1. Write documentation (todohs, doc) 
 
 $ todo add +todohs "Work on code"
 2. Work on code (todohs) 
 
 $ todo mod -doc 1
 1. Write documentation (todohs)

Complete an item
 $ todo did 1.
 Completed: 1. Write documentation (todohs)

Clean your history file, removes all completed items and resets item ids
 $ todo vacuum 

List your current items (optionally by tag)
 $ todo ls [tag]

Prioritize or deprioritize 
 $ todo pri 1 A
 Set priority A to "Write documentation".
 $ todo depri 1 A
 Removed priority from "Write documentation".

    
Each item is a single row in your todo.txt file. Each row has the following
format:
 id tsadd tsdone <pri> +tag +tag Your todo item here

The id of an item is defined by the total number of lines in the todo.txt
file. A history of completed items is kept within the file where id equal to 
the total number of lines of the document.

"tsadd" and "tsdone" denote timestamps of item addition and completion.
